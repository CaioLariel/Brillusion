Improvement project for Technical High School students at Senac Nações Unidas. Focus on creating equitable education.

We at Brillusion planned this project thinking about the huge difference in learning between public and private schools, so we planned a way to have equal education for everyone, without looking at who. We created a type of “school reinforcement”, where it works as follows: developed students would dynamically create content for other students. This way, everyone will have equal learning, in a relationship where everyone wins!
